    "The code we've written so far is much clearer, better organized, and easier to update than our first version. But there's one more (optional) thing that we can do to make full use of the functions we've created: add `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` at the top of our main method (which until we've been designating with an all-caps comment string).\n",

That's because the main method *is* a function (method and function are roughly interchangable words in Python, like library and module). By using `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`, we're making the functional nature of 'main' explicit.\n",
