New MS Course: Data Science for User Experience Researchers
HCDE 598
Data Science for User Experience Researchers
Success in many UX related roles, particularly user research, require workers to possess an understanding of data science concepts and to have facility with the tools of data analysis. This course introduces students to widely-adopted programming and data science tools to give them the skills to use data to answer questions about the characteristics, behaviors, and needs of people who use a wide variety of products.

This course has students working with real data from real users. It is built around scenarios that are directly relevant to performing user research in industry, such as:

* identifying user segments (e.g. power users) and popular content
* manipulating very large datasets (too big for Excel!)
* performing data visualization and statistical analysis using code (not GUIs)
* implementing experimental designs such as A/B tests and funnel analysis

The goal of the course is to provide students with a basic grasp of programming and data science concepts using tools that they can reuse elsewhere. No previous programming experience is required, or even expected.  While the course is framed around user research, the use-cases we will work with are relevant to a wide variety of non-engineering roles in software development and the broader technology industry.

**Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:**

* Write or modify a program to collect a dataset from Wikipedia or the City of Seattleâ€™s open data portal (Data.Seattle.gov)
* Effectively read web API documentation and write Python software to parse and understand a new and unfamiliar JSON-based web API.
* Understand database schemas and use MySQL to extract user data from relational databases.
* Use web-based data to effectively answer a substantively interesting question and to present this data effectively in the context of both a formal presentation and a written report.
