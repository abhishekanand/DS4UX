6. Which gets more inbound bike traffic per day, on averageâ€”the Burke-Gilman trail or the Mountain to Sound trail?
By 'inbound' I mean towards central Seattle. For BGT, inbound means southbound, for MTS, inbound means westbound.
To answer this question, you will need to alter bgt_traffic.py so that it takes BOTH bgt_bike_and_peds.csv and mts_bike_and_peds.csv as input, and converts them into TWO separate dictionaries. mts_bike_and_peds.csv is also included in the bgt-traffic.zip file you downloaded for this week's challenges.
The two files are in the same format, BUT there are a few differences that you need to account for (Hint: make sure to check the column titles and the order of the rows in each dataset!)
